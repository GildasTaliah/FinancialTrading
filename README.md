## Moving Average Based Strategy

This project (notebook name = MA_BasedStrategy) contains analyses based on **trend-following** trading strategy implemented with a selected pair of stocks, crypto currencies, commodities. The strategy utilizes Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicators to generate trading signals.

Results indicate that specific combinations of Moving Average (MA) values perform well for certain stocks but not for others which is unsurprising. Selected currencies and commodities with negative Sharpe ratios demonstrate improved performance under the Moving Average strategy.




## Machine Learning Stock Return Prediction Leveraging Technical Indicators

This project (notebook name = ML_BasedStrategy) explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict stock returns using technical indicators. The models used are decision trees and random forests, applied in both regression and classification contexts. In the classification approach, the model predicts the next day's movement (UP/DOWN, buy/sell), while in the regression approach, it predicts the next day's percentage return to determine buy/sell decisions based on predefined thresholds.

The experimentation shows promising results, with the Random Forest Regression model outperforming the others on average. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning models in stock return prediction, providing a foundation for further refinement and exploration in the field.
